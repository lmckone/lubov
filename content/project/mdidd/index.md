## Overview

This project is the result of a Pratt Institute School of Information graduate course, INFO 659: Advanced Projects in Digital Humanities â€“ Fall 2022, which built off of an introductory survey course of the methods, tools, and impacts of digital humanities. In this course, students and faculty worked together as co-researchers to scope the project and source the data. 

My main contribution to this project was the creation of a data textile intended to serve as an alternative knowledge object that can illuminate concepts core to critical data literacy such as the subjectivity of data collection and analysis, the invisibilized and undercompensated labor that underpins the field of data science, and the materiality of data and computation. 

Full project information can be found on the [project site](https://studentwork.prattsi.org/data-visceralization/).
