title: "Data Dictionaries 101: Tell the Story of your Data"
---

This is a plan for a workshop that provides an overview of data documentation and provides hands-on experience creating data dictionaries to graduate student researchers at a large university

#### Methods

I conducted a needs assessment based on a literature review grounding this project in the data information literacy needs of graduate students researchers. I created a program plan including learning objectives, outcomes, and evaluation instruments. I created supporting materials including a survey, slide deck, and worksheet to support the program.

#### My role

I am the sole author of this project.

#### Learning Outcome Achieved: _User-centered services_

This project is grounded in a needs assessment that demonstrates through a review of relevant literature the data information literacy needs of graduate researchers, and the best approaches for meeting this need. The workshop I designed caters to multiple learning modalities including presentation, group active learning strategies, and individual reflection that gives attendees the opportunity to connect the workshop content to their own experiences, demonstrating a user-centered approach to data information literacy instruction. Concepts related to data information literacy are presented in an accessible way, and additional resources in a variety of modalities (print, video, examples) are linked.
